<p align="justify">These online interaction spaces, where informational subjects will make use of social networking software, require new kinds of informational behaviors. In the case of organizational environments of teaching and research, it is necessary to develop skills and abilities for effective use of online resources focused on media literacy and information literacy.</p>

In this way, critical thinking and reflective capacity are the elements that guide relationships in the Network. Because they require, in addition to technical and technological capabilities, responsible and ethical actions of informational subjects in access, use and sharing of content.</p>
